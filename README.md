# Team Project Name

List of participants and affiliations:
- Michael Hearn, Data IT Department, Omega Therapeutics (Team Leader)
- Wenyu(Eddy)Huang, Department of Computer Science, Rice University
- Nicole Bowers, Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center, Argonne National Laboratory

## Project Goals
-Compare (?) pipelines for lineage identification of SARS-CoV-2 from metagenomic samples
-Quantify predicted differences in binding affinity between SARS-Cov-2 S protein and ACE2 receptors in diverse populations

## Approach
-Identify samples derived from metagenomic sampling with geolocation metadata
-Find nonsynonymous SNPs in S protein (from SARS-CoV-2 VCFs) and nonsynonymous SNPs in the ACE2 receptor (from 1kGP project VCFs)
## Results

## Future Work
