## Project Goals

Create visualization of binding affinities between SARS-CoV-2 S variants and ACE2 variants across diverse human populations.

The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enables viral entry. Missense mutations in S or ACE2 can increase the binding affinity which may increase susceptibility to infection in different populations. Missense variants in ACE2 are rare but distributed unevenly across populations.

## Approach

- Filter SARS-CoV-2 VCFs for samples derived from metagenomic sampling with geolocation metadata
- Identify nonsynonymous SNPs in S protein (from SARS-CoV-2 VCFs) and nonsynonymous SNPs in the ACE2 receptor (from 1kGP project VCFs)
  - Sample information from: https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample
  - ACE2 SNPs from http://Jul2023.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000130234;r=X:15494566-15607236;t=ENST00000252519
- Calculate predicted binding affinity for combinations of S variants and ACE2 variants

## Results

 - 5,521,380 samples with country-level location\
 - 7,638 unique variants

## Future Work
