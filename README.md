## Project Goals

Create visualization of binding affinities between SARS-CoV-2 S variants and ACE2 variants across diverse human populations.

## Approach

-Filter SARS-CoV-2 VCFs for samples derived from metagenomic sampling with geolocation metadata
-Identify nonsynonymous SNPs in S protein (from SARS-CoV-2 VCFs) and nonsynonymous SNPs in the ACE2 receptor (from 1kGP project VCFs)
-Calculate predicted binding affinity for combinations of S variants and ACE2 variants
